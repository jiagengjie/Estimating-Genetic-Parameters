# Estimating Genetic Parameters in the Absence of Genetic Data from Country-scale Health Datasets
## Heritability, Genetic Correlation, Environmental Correlation, and Phenotypic Correlation

### 1. Training_Data_H2.csv training dataset for the imputation of heritability

Column names are listed below and annotated in parentheses:

Disease (disease name), H2 (published heritability value), H2_se (standard error), Data_type (data type used in heritability estimation: “twin study,” “family study,” “family study using EHRs,” “SNP-based study,” and “PRS-based study”), Math_model_in_reference (math model used in heritability estimation:“AE,” “ACE,” “PRS,” “SOLAR,” “GREML,” and “LDSC”), Country_of_cohort, Gender_of_cohort, F0,..., F65 (normalized to 1 disease- and female-specific counts at ages between 0 and 65), M0,..., M65 (normalized to 1 disease- and male-specific counts at ages between 0 and 65), cumF0,..., cumF64 (female-specific cumulative counts, a sum of all normalized counts from age 0 till the age N), cumM0,...,cumM64 (male-specific cumulative counts, a sum of all normalized counts from age 0 till the age N), Median (Median age of disease carriers), C1,...,C20 (real-valued elements in the 20-dimensional embedding vector), System (general system that the disease belongs to), Gender (applicable gender), MtoF (male-to-female ratio in carriers), MeanPrev (mean prevalence), F_US_cluster (cluster label of US- and female-specific curve), F_Denmark_cluster (cluster label of Denmark- and female-specific curve), M_Denmark_cluster (cluster label of Denmark- and male-specific curve), M_US_cluster (cluster label of US- and male-specific curve), Onset (disease onset age)
   


### 2. Training_Data_Corr.csv training dataset for the imputation of correlation

Column names are listed below and annotated in parentheses:

True or False), F_Denmark_cluster_agree, M_Denmark_cluster_agree, M_US_cluster_agree, Cdiff1, Cmean1,..., Cdiff20, Cmean20 (mean and difference values of embedding elements of the disease pair), Fdiff0, Fmean0, Mdiff0, Mmean0, cumMdiff0, cumFdiff0,..., Fdiff65, Fmean65, Mdiff65, Mmean65, cumMdiff65, cumFdiff65 (gender-specific mean and difference values of the normalized counts and cumulative counts),CNS (one of the disease pair is in central nervous system? True or False), Cardiovascular, Digestive, Endocrine, Hematologic, Hepatic, Immune, Integumentary, Metabolic, Musculoskeletal, Neoplastic_Process, Non-Specific, Reproductive, Urinary, SameSystem (the disease pair belong to the same general system? True or False), SexMale (the disease pair are specific to male only? True or False), SexVariablesMatch (the applicable genders of the disease pair are the same? True or False)
